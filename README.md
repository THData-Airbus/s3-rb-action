# GitHub Action to delete S3 Bucket

Fork of [s3-rm-action](https://github.com/vitorsgomes/s3-rm-action).

This simple action uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) to delete files from a S3 bucket and delete the bucket.

## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

```yaml
name: Delete S3 bucket

on:
  delete:
    branches:
      - '*'
      - '!master'
jobs:
  remove:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Delete from S3
      uses: THData-Airbus/s3-rb-action@master
      env:
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET_NAME }}
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
```


### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) — otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.
